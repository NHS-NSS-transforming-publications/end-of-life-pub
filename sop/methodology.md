## Methodology

Each R script in the repository is commented as much as possible to explain what each section of the code is doing. However, there are a couple of more complex sections that require a bit more explanation. 

### Aggregating SMR data to Continuous Inpatient Stays (CIS), accounting for Care Home episodes

### Joining SMR01 and SMR04 data, accounting for some overlapping stays

### Producing Figure 2 - Health Board Map

### Excluding external causes of death, but including falls
