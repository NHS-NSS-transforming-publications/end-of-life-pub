## Introduction

The [NHS Healthcare Quality Strategy](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Health/Policy/Quality-Strategy) was launched in May 2010 by the Scottish Government with the aim of delivering high quality healthcare services to the people of Scotland. A direct action identified by the Quality Strategy was to develop a [Quality Measurement Framework](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Health/Policy/Quality-Strategy/Quality-Measurement-Framework) supporting a number of Quality Outcome Measures (QOMs). These measures cover a range of healthcare topics including; care experience, healthcare acquired infections, hospital mortality rates and end of life care.

<br>

This release by Information Services Division presents information in support of the objectives set out in the December 2015 ["Strategic Framework for Action on Palliative and End of Life Care"](http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0049/00491388.pdf) which has one of its commitments to “support improvements in the collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of data and evidence relating to needs, provision, activity, indicators and outcomes in respect of palliative and end of life care”. This strategic framework superseded ["Living and Dying Well: A National Action Plan for Palliative and End of Life in Scotland"](http://www.gov.scot/Resource/Doc/239823/0066155.pdf). 

<br>

Ideally, the measure would relate directly to an individual’s preferred place of care at the end of their life. However, there are challenges around capturing this information. There is no national and systematic data recorded on a person’s preferred place of care at the end of life and this publication uses instead the following surrogate measure: *“Percentage of last six months spent at home or in a community setting”*. Although this is not a direct measure of compliance with an individual’s preferred place of death, it can serve to provide a broad indication of progress in implementing the national action plan. 

<br>

More recently in December 2016 the ["Health and Social Care Delivery Plan"](http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0051/00511950.pdf) was launched, which reinforces key actions and services to respond to palliative and end of life care needs among other health and social care priorities.

### Provisional Figures 

Note that hospital data and National Records of Scotland deaths data are provisional for `r latest$fy`. This publication will be updated in October `r year(end_date)` with final figures.  Figures for the latest year should therefore be treated with caution as there could be an undercount of hospital admissions, particularly for people who died in the last three months of the year.  This is not expected to have a large impact on these published figures when they are revised in subsequent updates. See [Appendix 2](#appendix-2---background-information) for more information.

## Main Points

* In `r latest$fy`, there were `r latest$deaths` deaths in Scotland excluding those where an external cause of death was recorded (including falls).  For these individuals, `r latest$qom`% of their last six months of life was spent either at home or in a community setting, with the remaining `r latest$qom_hosp`% spent in hospital. This is equivalent to an average of `r latest$hosp` days in hospital in the six months prior to death.

* Over the past `r trend_length` years, the percentage of time spent at home or in a community setting has gradually increased from `r summarise_data(basefile, include_years = "first") %>% pull(qom)`% in `r min(basefile$fy)` to `r latest$qom`% in `r latest$fy`.

* In `r latest$fy`, `r max_old`s aged 85 and over spent a higher percentage of their last six months of life in the community (`r max(old$qom)`%) compared to `r min_old`s (`r min(old$qom)`%); this equates to `r max_old`s spending, on average an extra `r as.character(day_diff(max(old$qom), min(old$qom)))` days in the community in their last six months of life.

## Results and Commentary

For the `r latest$deaths` residents of Scotland who died in financial year `r latest$fy`, `r latest$qom`% of their last six months of life was spent either at home or in the community (Table 1) and `r latest$qom_hosp`% of their last six months of life was spent in hospital. This is equivalent to each individual spending an average of `r latest$hosp` days in hospital in the six months prior to their death (Table 1 in the [data tables](`r data_tables`)).

Over the `r trend_length` years, `r min(basefile$fy)` to `r latest$fy`, the percentage of time spent at home or in a community setting has increased from `r basefile %>% summarise_data(include_years = "first") %>% pull(qom)`% to `r latest$qom`%, this equates to, on average an extra `r day_diff(basefile %>% summarise_data(include_years = "first") %>% pull(qom), latest$qom)` days within the last six months of life being spent at home or in a community setting in `r latest$fy` compared to `r min(basefile$fy)` (see Figure 1 below or [Appendix 1](#appendix-1---trend-data)).

### Health Board of Residence
Figure 2 shows the variation in the percentage of time spent at home or in the community in the last six months of life across Scotland by NHS Board. 

The NHS Board where residents spent the highest percentage of time in their last six months of life at home or in the community was `r max_hb$hb` where `r max_hb$qom`% of an individual’s last six months of life was spent at home or in a community setting and `r max_hb$qom_hosp`% in hospital. On average, this equates to approximately `r max_hb$hosp` days spent in a hospital setting within the last six months of life. 

The NHS Board with the lowest percentage of time on average spent at home or in a community setting in their last six months of life was `r min_hb$hb` where `r min_hb$qom`% of an individual’s last six months of life was spent at home or in a community setting and `r min_hb$qom_hosp`% in hospital. This equates to approximately `r min_hb$hosp` days spent in a hospital setting within the last six months of life. The variation in percentages across Scotland could be affected by the age profile and rurality of the different health boards.

Note that hospital data are provisional for `r latest$fy`. This publication will be updated in October `r year(pub_date)` with final figures. _More detail of completeness here_. See [Appendix 2](#appendix-2---background-information) for more information.

### Health and Social Care Partnership
Table 2 shows the percentage of the last six months of life spent at home or in a community setting for each Health and Social Care Partnership. 

Note that hospital data are provisional for `r latest$fy`. This publication will be updated in October `r year(end_date)` with final figures.  Figures for the latest year should therefore be treated with caution particularly NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde and NHS Forth Valley. There could be an undercount of hospital admissions, particularly for people who died in the last three months of the year. See [Appendix 2](#appendix-2---background-information) for more information.

Table 2 shows that there is some variation between Partnerships with the percentage of time spent at home or in a community setting ranging from `r min_hscp$qom`% (`r min_hscp$hscp`) to `r max_hscp$qom`% (`r max_hscp$hscp`). This could be due to differences in the age profile and rurality of each of the local areas.

<br>

The trend in the percentage of the last six months of life spent at home or in a community setting over the past `r trend_length` years for Health and Social Care Partnerships is presented in graphical format in Figure A1.2 (see [List of Tables](#Tables) or [Appendix 1](#appendix-1---trend-data)) and the corresponding data can be found in Table 2 in the [data tables](data_tables). 

<br>

### Age and Gender
Figure 3 below presents the percentage of time spent at home or in the community in the last six months by age group and gender (Table 3 in the [data tables](data_tables)). In `r latest$fy`, for all ages combined there was a similar percentage of time spent at home or in a community setting for females (`r allages %>% filter(sex == "Female") %>% pull(qom)`%) and males (`r allages %>% filter(sex == "Male") %>% pull(qom)`%). For individuals aged 85 years and over, `r max_old`s (`r max(old$qom)`%) spent a higher percentage of their last six months of life at home or in the community compared to `r min_old`s (`r min(old$qom)`%); this equates to `r max_old`s spending, on average, an extra `r as.character(day_diff(max(old$qom), min(old$qom)))` days in the community. In the youngest age group (0-54 years), `r max_young`s (`r max(young$qom)`%) spent a higher percentage of their last six months of life at home or in the community compared to `r min_young`s (`r min(young$qom)`%); this equates to, on average, an extra `r as.character(day_diff(max(young$qom), min(young$qom)))` days at home or in the community.

<br>

### Deprivation
The percentage of time spent at home or in a community setting in the last six months of life by deprivation is shown in Figure 4 (Table 4 in the [data tables](data_tables). Deprivation category has been assigned using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation. At a Scotland level approximately 20% of the population are within each deprivation quintile with deprivation category 1 relating to the most deprived areas and deprivation category 5 to the least deprived areas. See the [Glossary](#Glossary) for further information on Deprivation.

2. Deprivation 2016 quintiles have been used.
</div>

<br>

Figure 4 shows that there is little variation across the different categories of deprivation. Deprivation ranges from `r min(simd$qom)`% (deprivation category `r max_simd`) to `r max(simd$qom)`% (deprivation category `r min_simd`). The trend over time by deprivation category is presented in Figure A1.3 (see [List of Tables](#Listoftables) or [Appendix 1](#appendix-1---trend-data)). All deprivation categories show a similar trend over time, with a slight increase in the percentage of last six months spent at home or in the community for individuals in the last two or three years. For each year in the trend (`r min(basefile$fy)` to `r latest$fy`) there is little variation across the different deprivation categories.

<br>

### Urban Rural Classification
The Scottish Government 6-fold [urban rural classification](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/About/Methodology/UrbanRuralClassification) has been used to present information on whether people live in Urban or Rural areas and if there is any difference in the amount of time spent at home or in a community setting in the six months prior to death (Figure 5).

The percentage of the last six months of life spent at home or in the community ranged from `r min(ur$qom)`% for residents in `r min_ur` to `r max(ur$qom)`% for residents from `r max_ur` (Figure 5; Table 5 in [data tables](data_tables)). Individuals living in `r max_ur` spent, on average, approximately `r as.character(day_diff(max(ur$qom), min(ur$qom)))` extra days at home or in a community setting in the last six months of life compared to those living in `r min_ur`.

Trend data on the percentage of the last six months of life spent at home or in a community setting by Urban/Rural classification are presented in Figure A1.4 (see [List of Tables](#list-of-tables) or [Appendix 1](#appendix-1---trend-data)).

### Appendix 2 - Background Information

End of life care (palliative care) is an important, integral aspect of the health care provided to those living with and dying from any advanced or progressive and life-threatening condition. 

The [NHS Healthcare Quality Strategy](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Health/Policy/Quality-Strategy) (May 2010) was launched with the aim of delivering high quality healthcare services to people in Scotland. A direct action identified by the Quality Strategy was to develop a [Quality Measurement Framework](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Health/Policy/Quality-Strategy/Quality-Measurement-Framework) supporting a number of Quality Outcome Measures (QOMs). These measures cover a range of healthcare topics including; care experience, healthcare acquired infections, hospital mortality rates and end of life care.

The December 2015 ["Strategic Framework for Action on Palliative and End of Life Care"](http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0049/00491388.pdf) was published to “support improvements in the collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of data and evidence relating to needs, provision, activity, indicators and outcomes in respect of palliative and end of life care”. This strategic framework superseded ["Living and Dying Well: A National Action Plan for Palliative and End of Life in Scotland"](http://www.gov.scot/Resource/Doc/239823/0066155.pdf). 

More recently, the December 2016 the ["Health and Social Care Delivery Plan"](http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0051/00511950.pdf) reinforces key actions and services to respond to palliative and end of life care needs among other health and social care priorities. 

This publication provides information in support of the Quality Measurement Framework to develop Quality Outcome Measure 10: ‘The percentage of last six months of life spent at home or in a community setting’.

The proportion of time spent at home or in a community setting towards the end of life provides a high level indication of progress in implementation of the national action plan. This is inferred by measuring the amount of time spent in a hospital setting during the last months of life (using hospital admissions data) and from this estimating the time spent at home or in a community setting.   

It is envisaged that an increase in this measure will reflect both quality and value through more effective, person centred and efficient end of life care with people being better able to be cared for at home or closer to home with a planned approach to end of life care resulting in less time in a hospital setting. 

Over time, an increase in the proportion of time spent at home / in a community setting at the end of life may indicate an improvement in the quality and efficiency of palliative care. This increase would be expected in the medium to long term as a result of an increase in the use of anticipatory care plans and electronic palliative care summaries. 

This measure is based on Acute Inpatient and Day Case and Geriatric Long Stay (SMR01/SMR01 GLS) and Mental Health Inpatient and Day Case (SMR04), returns covering non-obstetric hospitals in Scotland. 

### Data Quality and Completeness

Hospital data and National Records of Scotland deaths data are provisional for `r latest$fy`. Figures for the latest year should therefore be treated with caution as there could be an undercount of hospital admissions, particularly for people who died in the last three months of the year. 

Estimated completeness figures for Acute Inpatient and Day Case records (SMR01) are presented in the following table. Note that there are particular issues with completeness for NHS Forth Valley and NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde data for the last quarter (Quarter 4) of `r latest$fy` and so data for these areas in particular should be treated with caution.

#### SMR01 Completeness Table HERE

This publication will be updated in October `r next_pub_date` with final figures.

### Appendix 3 - Methodology

This publication includes data from financial years `r min(basefile$fy)` to `r latest$fy` at Scotland, Health Board and Health and Social Care Partnership level. 

### Calculation of Measure

Scottish residents who died between `r min(basefile$fy)` and `r latest$fy` are identified using date of death on National Records of Scotland death records. The possible number of bed days that could have been spent in hospital in a six-month period is calculated by multiplying the total number of deaths by 182.5. Patients who died where an external cause of death (e.g. unintentional injuries) is recorded on the death record have been excluded from the analysis; however patients who died where a fall is recorded are included. Patients with missing postcodes have also been excluded. 

The deaths data are linked to hospital discharge data (SMR01 and SMR04) and the actual number of bed days spent in hospital in Scotland in the six months prior to the death of each individual is calculated and added together for all individuals. This includes bed days from all acute and community hospitals, psychiatric hospitals or geriatric long stay facilities.

The percentage of time spent in hospital in the last six months of life is therefore arrived at by dividing the actual number of bed days by the possible number of bed days. The percentage of time spent at home or in a community setting is then obtained by subtracting the percentage of time spent in hospital from 100%. 

For each financial year from `r min(basefile$fy)` to `r latest$fy` this report presents the percentage of the last six months of life that was spent at home or in a community setting for patients who died within each financial year. A summary of how the measure is calculated is shown below.

         c("Total bed days in hospital in the 6 months prior to death for those people who died within specific year",
           "Total number of deaths in specified period x 182.5",
           "(Actual bed days / possible bed days) x 100",
           "100 - % of time in hospital in last 6 months before death")),
